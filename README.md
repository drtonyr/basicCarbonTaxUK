# carbonTaxBackstop

This code models the use of a [Carbon Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax) as a way of guaranteeing [net carbon zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality).  It uses UK spending habits from the [Office of National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/detailedhouseholdexpenditurebydisposableincomedecilegroupuktable31) to estimate the impact of a Carbon Tax in terms of changes in expenditure and income raised.

To run just execute `python3 carbonTaxBackstop.py` which will write docs/README.md and the associated images.  The project ships with standard output which can also viewed at [drtonyr.github.io/carbonTaxBackstop](https://drtonyr.github.io/carbonTaxBackstop)

The code has only been tested on Ubuntu, it shouldn't be too difficult to get it going on other platforms.
