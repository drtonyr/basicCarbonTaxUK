# basicCarbonTaxUK
Python code to investigate how a Basic Carbon Tax could help the UK could get to Net Carbon Zero

This code investigates the use of a basic [Carbon Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax) as one means to get to [net carbon zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality).  It uses UK spending habits from the [Office of National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/detailedhouseholdexpenditurebydisposableincomedecilegroupuktable31) to estimate the impact of a Carbon Tax.   It is acknowledged that there are many ways to get to net carbon zero and that a blend of methods is far more useful than one method alone.  Nevertheless, this single method provides insights and is freely available incorporate in other work.

To run just execute `python3 basicCarbonTaxUK.py` which will write docs/README.md and the associated images.  The project ships with standard output which can also viewed at [https://drtonyr.github.io/basicCarbonTaxUK]

The code has only been tested on Ubuntu, it shouldn't be too difficult to get it going on other platforms.
